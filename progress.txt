## Progress

### Part 1
- setup and familiarize code
- run test to understand beforeEach/afterEach
- test API in Insomnia 
- write tests for helper/sql.js/{sqlForPartialUpdate}
- Document the function of sqlForPartialUpdate
    1. sqlForPartialUpdate passes in 2 arguments, first is the data and second is the format of jsToSql.
    2. Once data is passed in, it is turned into an array and then mapped to create a key and variable value like 'first_name=$1, age='$2'. This is in preparation for the UPDATE syntax in psql. 
    3. The function returns the formatted syntax for psql as well as actual values that will be updated. 
    4. In models/user.js we can destructure the return of sqlForPartialUpdate() of the columns to be updated as well as the values which help to efficiently write the UPDATE syntax in psql.
